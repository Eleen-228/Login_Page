# Login Page [Go to Page](https://eleen-228.github.io/Registration_Login_UserCenter_Pages/)

A project to build login, registration and user center pages.

## Purpose

The goal of this login page is to practice and be familiar with how these frontend tools/libraries coordinate with React: Material UI, formik, yup, firebase, and fullcalendar.

## Details

Material UI is one of the most popular UI tools being used by frontend developers with React Framework. Although the learning curve of this tool is not that flat for me, with persistence, I was able to use it in my project by learning and studying from its official documents and tutorials. Material UI supports customized and responsive UI design of our frontend projects. For this project, I customized the color palette for dark and light mode theme. As well as making the app responsive using its build-in components.

In addition, formik and yup were used in this project for form controls and validations. Able to utilize formik and yup simplified the complexity of creating a form by implementing their build-in form state management, validation and error handling.

Firebase is used on this project for login authentication that uses either basic email/password sign in or google sign in. Account users also have the options to delete their accounts; change their username, email and password from the user center.

FullCalendar is imported for calendar section of the user center page. That allows user to add any events to the calendar and remove any existed one from the calendar.

## Project Status

Most functions of the pages have been achieved. Any additional functionalities might be add afterward.
