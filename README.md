# Login Page

A project to build a login page

## Purpose

The goal of this login page is to practice and be familiar with how these frontend tools/libraries coordinate with React: Material UI, formik, yup and firebase.

## Details

Material UI is one of the most popular UI tools being used by frontend developers with React Framework. Although the learning curve of this tool is not that flat for me, with persistence, I was able to use it in my project by learning and studying from its official documents and tutorials. Material UI supports customized and responsive UI design of our frontend projects. For this project, I customized the color palette for dark and light mode theme. As well as making the app responsive using its build-in components.

In addition, formik and yup were used in this project for form controls and validations. Able to utilize formik and yup simplified the complexity of creating a form by implementing their build-in form state management, validation and error handling.

## Project Status

As of now, this project has not yet completed. I am still working on how to implement firebase on this project for credential authentication.
